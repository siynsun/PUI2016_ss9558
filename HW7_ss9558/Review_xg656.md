Reviewer:Xianbo Gao, xg656.

Generally speaking, it's good plot which shows information clearly.


There are x-axis labels, y-axis labels and legends. These labels provide useful information. However, the title is missing. A title can clearly indicate what the plot want to show.

The plot is big and clear. The colors are simple and distinguishable. The labels are cleaer as well. It's a beautiful plot.
However, the widths of red bars and blue bars are not the same. It's better to use same width. There's a possibility that red bars cover blue bars. It's better to stack them.

The plot honestly reproduced the data. It's an honest plot.
