Generally speaking, it's able to read the plot, but there's room for improvement.


The first plot should move up so that it won't cover the title "Temperature".
The x-axis labels and y-axis labels are needed. Besides, it is recommanded to add the units of x and y quantities as well.
There are two lines: one dotted line and one solid line. The label of these lines are needed.
There are altogether 4 plots but there's only two titles. Besides, the titles can be more specificated to incated more information.

The plot is a bit small and crowded. Besides, it's not necessary to use dot lines in 2nd, 3rd and 4th plot.
3rd and 4th plot looks exactly the same. In order to provide more information, maybe it's better to use other methods such as plotting something like error bar.


The plot honestly reproduced the data.
