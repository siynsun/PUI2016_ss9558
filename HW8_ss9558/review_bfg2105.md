Bailey's scatter plot shows the relationship between stations and the number of rides for different genders as the caption accurately describes. The caption also mentions the source of the data and the time period,which is nice. 

The plot is missing a title and the type size of the axis-labels is a bit small compared to the size of the graph.

The plot is a little bit ambiguous since the number of station is only an index instead of a quantitative measurement. In my opininon, using the scatter plot is not appropriate here. Additionally, since the plot only shows the total number of rides for female and male in each station, the comparsion on gender is not that clear. Though in all the men group shows a larger number of riders on average, we have no idea it results from a larger rider group or a more frequent ridership.
