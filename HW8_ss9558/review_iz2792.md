Zhou's scatter plot clearly shows the relationship between CO2 emission and population size or population density.The caption also mentions the source of the data and the time period,which is nice. 
The title, legend and size of the axis-labels are all clear and appropriate.

The plot is well organized in total, but since there is some overlap in the data point (especially when the dots are small), I would suggest using different colors to represent different densities.  I would also suggest to put CO2 emission in the y axis and population size in the x axis.
